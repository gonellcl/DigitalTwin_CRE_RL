# DigitalTwin_CRE_RL
Digital Twin Simulation for Commercial Real Estate with Reinforcement Learning agents simulating leasing trends, tenant behaviors, and economic events.
## Project Description
The project provides an adaptive digital twin model of a commerical building designed to demonstrate the potential benefits of using digital twins for forecasting, analysis, and decision-making in real estate management. While the model is intentionally limited in scope and complexity, it offers a foundational framework for optimizing leasing strategies through simulated interactions between tenants and economic variables. 

This digital twin captures tenant behavior in response to macroeconomic trends between 1990-2023. By simulating diverse economic conditions such as growth periods, downturns, and market shocks, the model provides insignt into how broader economic forces impact tenant decisions, lease lengths, and oocupancy rates. The project acts as a scalable framework that can be expanded to model more complex relationships and dynmaics within the commerical real estate sector. 

Ultimately, the adaptive digital twin servies as a decision-support tool for real estate professionals as it supports strategic evaluation of leasing policies, tenant retention efforts, and economic resilience in simulated real-world condiitons.
